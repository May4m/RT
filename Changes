I've created new tyepdef data types..
  * int is now replaced by t_i32;
  * double is now replaced by t_f32;
  * double is now replaced by t_f64;
  * boolean varibales are define by t_bool;


Yay!!!!!! The matrix library is here.... I mean coming.

 * A t_f64 matrix of an arbitrary size if defined by 't_matrix'
 * A t_f64 matrix of size 4x4 is defined by 't_matrix44'
 * Matrices just like vectors work on a stack... I generally use small matrices atmost 4x4
 * Matrices can work with vectors... yea.. the t_vec3f.
 * Only the essential part of the matrix library is implemented.
 
 
 for transformation
 * apply the inverse transformation matrix to the ray origin and direction
 * then apply the inverse transformation matrix to the point of intersection
